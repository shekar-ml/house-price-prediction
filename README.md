# house-price-prediction
This project is about predicting house prices in Bengaluru. I started by cleaning and preparing the data, handling missing values and outliers. Then, I used different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge) to build a model that can predict the price of a house based on its location, size, no. of bathrooms, and no. of bedrooms (bhk). Finally, I evaluated how well each model performed and saved the best one.
